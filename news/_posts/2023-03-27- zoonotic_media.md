[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/23/bacteria-meat-uti-urinary-tract-gwu-study-ecoli/) and [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/03/23/uti-bladder-infections-linked-e-coli-meat/11509214002/) covered our [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000381?via%3Dihub) on quantifing how many UTI's in the US are likely from meat people consumed/came in contact with. For this, we developed a [statistical method](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.13580) that combine phylogenetics and Bayesian latent class models for mobile genetic elements.
