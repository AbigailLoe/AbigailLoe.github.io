Congratulations to PhD Student Xingran Chen's new exciting work accepted to Journal of American Informatics Association (JAMIA): [Generating Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data: A Methodological Scoping Review with Benchmarking on Phenotype Data and Open-Source Software](https://zhenkewu.com/papers/synthetic_benchmark). 

Xingran made a neat extensible Python Package [`synthEHRella`](https://github.com/chenxran/synthEHRella) for conducting benchmarking of popular EHR generation methods. The current benchmarking focuses on cross-sectional structured data.
