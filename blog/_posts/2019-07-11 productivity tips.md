## Tags

- OSX provides “tags” for your to color-label and group folders and files. This lowers the barrier to start anything you hope to do (["the path of minimal resistance"](http://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/#philosophy)). I usually use tags for grouping
	- *reviews*: set an orange color (with label `review_to_do`) and tag all the folders that contain the works to be reviewed.
	- *current writing project*: For me, this will most likely be a paper; create a tag `paper_awesomeidea`. I usually put the `.tex`, `.bib` and `zwcommands.sty` (my own definition of shortcuts) along with other necessary files (e.g., `figs/`, `references`) together. When I have the corresponding R code in another folder, I will also tag the folder with the same color/label.
