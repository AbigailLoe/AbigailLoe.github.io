<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Recent studies explored which pathogens drive the global burden of pneumonia hospitalizations among young children. However, the etiology of broader acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) remains unclear.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>Using a multi-country study (Albania, Jordan, Nicaragua, and the Philippines) of hospitalized infants and non-ill community controls between 2015-2017, we assessed the prevalence and severity of viral infections and co-infections. We also estimated the proportion of ALRI-hospitalizations caused by 21 respiratory pathogens identified via multiplex real-time RT-PCR using Bayesian Nested Partially Latent Class Models.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>3,632 hospitalized infants and 1,068 non-ill community controls participated in the study and had specimens tested. Among hospitalized infants, 1,743 (48.0%) met the ALRI case-definition for the etiology analysis. After accounting for prevalence in non-ill controls, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was responsible for the largest proportion of ALRI hospitalizations though the magnitude varied across sitesâ€”ranging from 65.2% (95% Credible Interval [CrI]: 46.3,79.6) in Albania to 34.9% (95% CrI: 20.0, 49.0) in the Philippines. While the fraction of ALRI hospitalizations caused by RSV decreased as age increased, it remained the greatest driver. After RSV, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RV/EV) (range: 13.4%-27.1%), and human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) (range: 6.3%-12.0%) were the next highest contributors to ALRI hospitalizations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>We observed substantial numbers of ALRI hospitalizations with RSV the largest source, particularly in infants aged &lt;3 months. This underscores the potential for vaccines and long-lasting monoclonal antibodies on the horizon to reduce the burden of ALRI in infants worldwide.</p>
