# Abstract

Accurate identification of synergistic treatment combinations and their underlying biological  mechanisms  is  critical  across  many  disease  domains,  especially  cancer.   In  translational oncology research, preclinical systems such as patient-derived xenografts (PDX) have emerged as a unique study design evaluating multiple treatments administered to samplesfrom the same human tumor implanted into mice.  In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian probabilistic tree-based framework using PDX data to investigate the hierarchical relationships between treatments by inferring treatment cluster trees, referred to as treatment trees (Rx-tree).   The  framework  also  motivates  a  new  metric  of  mechanistic  similarity  between two  or  more  treatments  accounting  for  inherent  uncertainty  in  tree  estimation.   Building upon Dirichlet Diffusion Trees, we derive a closed-form marginal likelihood encoding the tree structure, which facilitates computationally efficient posterior inference via a new two-stage algorithm.  Simulation studies demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in recovering the tree structure and treatment similarities.  Our analyses of a recently collated PDX dataset show a high degree of concordance with known biological mechanisms across five cancers and high mechanistic similarity between treatments.  More importantly, we uncover  new  and  potentially  effective  combination  therapies  that  confer  possible  synergistic regulation of specific downstream biological pathways for future clinical investigations.
