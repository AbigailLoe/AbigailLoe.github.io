Bio:
======

Zhenke Wu is Assistant Professor of Biostatistics, and Research Assistant Professor in Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He received his Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins University in 2014 and then stayed at Hopkins for his postdoctoral training. His work has focused on the design and application of statistical methods that inform health decisions made by individuals, or precision medicine. In particular, he has worked on case-control analysis of population and individual etiology of childhood pneumonia, analysis of modern study designs, gel electrophoresis autoradiography data and mobile health data for maintaining physical activity and understanding depression. The original methods and software developed are now used by investigators from research institutes such as US CDC and Johns Hopkins, as well as site investigators from developing countries, e.g., Kenya, South Africa, Gambia, Mali, Zambia, Thailand and Bangladesh.
