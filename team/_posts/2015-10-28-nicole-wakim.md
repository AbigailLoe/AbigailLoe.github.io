# Research Interest

*"Statistical Methods for Functional Data Streams of Digital Biomarkers in Predicting Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes."*

Nicole currently focuses on high-frequency digital biomarker data in Alzheimer’s and dementia research. Her research position at the Michigan Alzheimer’s Data Center has led to her interest in functional data analysis as a method to investigate trajectories of digital biomarkers as predictors of cognitive decline.


# Education:

2018, M.S. in Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
